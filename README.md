# TESA-uncertainty-talk
Talk on uncertainty for 2018 TESA WebEx series (Introduction to Stock Assessment), with shorter 20-minute version for 2020 TESA Risk workshop.

Slides (and style to share with Dan Ricard) for talk on 1st November 2018. I think these are essentially the default beamer style, and I made a bit of a cover page though need to add a picture of some sort.

**talk/**

**beamer-hake-assessment.rnw** - our 2018 hake assessment talk to use some of as a template. Won't run here (as model results not here). Dan - I sent you the .pdf.

**uncertainty-talk.Rnw** - using hake as a template, simplifying down to give example of making a figure, including images, bullet points and the TOC along the top. 

Looks like these are the beamer defaults, I actually like the moving contents thing along the top (points are clickable) - could move to the bottom and delete the bottom-right stuff and move page numbers to bottom-right. Out of time to play with that now - should be easier enough to figure out.

**edwards-uncertainty.Rnw** - shortening to 20-minute version for Risk workshop in Ottawa, January 2020.
